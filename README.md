The amplifier has 4 sliders. You may adjust the Distortion amount, the range of the distortion, the blend (or mix) of the dry/wet tone,
as well as the output volume.

Best of all, JulesAMP is available in VST3/AU/AAX Format, so it is compatible with a wide range of Digital Audio Workstations (DAW's).

This includes: Reaper, Cubase, Ableton, Pro Tools, and Logic Pro.

Made in C++ with the JUCE framework.
